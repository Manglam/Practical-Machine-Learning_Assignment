Assignment--Practical Machine Learning
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#setting working directory for data 
wd_data <- "C:/Users/zik48224/Downloads/Practical Machine Learning"
setwd(wd_data)

tr <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
test <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

#No need for observatio number. so removing it
tr <- tr[,-1]
#removing timestamps
tr <- tr[,-c(1:3)]


#Doing gbm to understand important variables
library(caret)
library(gbm)
model1 <- gbm(classe~.,data=tr,n.trees=100,interaction.depth=6,shrinkage=0.001)
summary(model1)

#taking only important varibales from the train set 
tr_n <- tr[,c("roll_belt","num_window","pitch_forearm","magnet_dumbbell_y",
  	  "magnet_dumbbell_z","yaw_belt","yaw_arm","magnet_belt_z",
		  "roll_dumbbell","accel_forearm_x","gyros_dumbbell_y",
		  "accel_dumbbell_y","accel_dumbbell_x","accel_dumbbell_z",
		  "accel_forearm_z","gyros_belt_z","accel_arm_x","pitch_belt",
		  "magnet_belt_y","magnet_forearm_x","magnet_forearm_z",
		  "magnet_dumbbell_x","roll_forearm","classe")]
model1 <- train(classe ~.,tr_n,method="gbm")
summary(model1$finalModel)
pred <- predict(model1$finalModel,test)
```

summary Plot

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
summary(model1$finalModel)
```
